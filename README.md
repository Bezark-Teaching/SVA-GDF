## **Course Objectives:**
- Understand the principles of game design and development.
- Gain proficiency in Godot 4.5.
- Develop basic coding skills relevant to game design.
- Complete three major game design projects: a tabletop game, a 2D game, and a capstone game.
- Enhance writing and oral presentation skills through game-related assignments.
- Be able to better work in teams
- Respond to critical feedback constructively

# **Assessment**

The  work of the class consists of the following:
